# Octodex: An HTML and CSS Exercise
GitHub has a great mascot called Octocat. Octocat even has its own gallery of variations, created by GitHub itself and fans, called [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com).

You can use all the tools you have at your disposal to get the job done. Use your browser's Developer Tools to inspect their site to find the exact font sizes and padding amounts.

## Objectives

- Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
- Implement, from scratch, a given design
- Understand HTML/CSS Layout
- Be able to place elements on a page where you want them.
- Use flexbox and grid techniques layout pages.
- Work with media queries to build a responsive page.

## Requirements

- You should strive to implement the design as close as possible, though, especially if you've never touch HTML or CSS before, this can be extraordinarily difficult and will take a lot of practice and mileage.

- [ ] Use `app-app` with `alpha` and name your project `Octodex`
- [ ] Recreate the page as closely as you possibly can. Use the same fonts, sizes, and colors. Use your browser's developers tool to determine the colors and fonts.
- [ ] Select _some_ Octocats to use on your page (`12` to `16` or so). Your layout should be flexible but doesn't need to _perfectly_ responsive.
  - Don't bother downloading details of the Octocat, we've [made a site]((https://sdg-octodex.herokuapp.com/) that will give you all the data you need.
- [ ] Use CSS _media queries_ to resize the Octocat containers to look great as the screen changes size. Even though the site has a desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile display, for explorer mode only worry about desktop and mobile.
- [ ] Deploy your site.
- **TIP** Reminder to breakdown the layout into smaller chunks that are easier to style
